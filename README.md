# youtube-downloader

### This youtube downloader was created so I can download videos that I could watch offline. I mainly used this to download tutorials and unplug my WiFi so I do not get distracted. It is really helpful for when I need to focus or go on a plane where I could watch hours of my favorite ghost hunters!

## How it's made:
Tech used: Python

## Optimizations
When I impove this project, I would like to improve the downloading part of it. There's a bug where sometimes it does not work.


## Lesson Learned:
I learned how to create a GUI and uses of different Python modules to create this project.
